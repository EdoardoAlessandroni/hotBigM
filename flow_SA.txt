ONE-SHOT strategy (if we know how to pick an annealing schedule from the LCBO)
1. Get LCBO
2. Choose an annealing schedule for SA (same as DA? same only its final temperature? completely different to adapt to SA different scheme?)
3. From [LCBO, \beta_{final}] compute M^*, \eta_{guarantee} using our algorithm. Also, compute M_{\ell_1}( \beta_{final} )
4. Run SA on QUBO(M^*) and collect samples X
5. From [LCBO, X] computed sampled energies [E_o, E_p](both objective and penalization)


SCAN strategy (if we have no clue for picking an annealing schedule from the LCBO)
1. Get LCBO
2. Scan the M: \forall M do:
    3. Compute \beta_{initial}, \beta_{final}, schedule from QUBO(M)
    4. Run SA on QUBO(M^*) and collect samples X
    5. From [LCBO, X] computed sampled energies [E_o, E_p](both objective and penalization)
6. From [LCBO, \beta_{final}] compute M^*, \eta_{guarantee} using our algorithm. Also, compute M_{\ell_1}( \beta_{final} )
7. Compare results of the scan wrt M^* figures of merit


DICHOTOMIC search strategy:
1. Get LCBO and eta_target
2. Pick M and cycle through:
    3. Build QUBO(M)
    4. Compute \beta_{initial}, \beta_{final}, schedule from QUBO(M)
    5. Run SA and compute prob_success
    6. if prob_success > eta_target, reduce M, else increase it
7. Converge to M_ideal, corresponding to the M that ensures eta_target probability of success


(also: scan the different possible temperatures?)



Analysis
- From [E_o, E_p] compute \eta_{effective} and prob_{feas}
- log_2(M^* / M_{\ell_1})
- \eta_{effective} vs \eta_{guarantee} 
(- M^* vs M_{search} only if we use SA for dichotomic search too)
- ...
